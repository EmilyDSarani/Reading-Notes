# Reading-Notes

HTML/CSS:

Ch.1 -Disucsses a lot of what we have already learned in class this week. It goes through the different parts of what < p > is as well as what code looks like. I appreciate this book because instead of a normal text book, this really gives a lot of examples and it is easy to follow along. I would recommend this book to anyone who is learning to code for the first time. 

Ch.8 - apparantly there are different versions of HTML. I was not aware of this at all, but this chapter touches upon that just a bit in the beginning. This chapter. I also did not know what the use of DOCTYPE was, but in this chapter I learned it is to declare what type of HTML you are using. That is insane...

ch.17- Is HTML 5 the newest one? I suppose I can google it, but if someone see's this before I do, please let me know? Anways, This chapter speaks a bit the traditional HTML layouts vs the new HTML layouts. Which it is really cool to see that side-by-side comparision. A lot of what we have already covered in class is in this chapter about the different grouping. Though, I dont recall learning about <hgroup></hgroup>. The books talks about it, but what is the point of this grouping?

ch. 18- Oh! I liked this chapter! It has a lot of similiar information that a lot of my marketing classes and website design classes had! This is cool because it forces the coder to think beyond the code. Who is the website for, why is it like this, what style would make it appealing? All of these questions are super important when working in design. I like the idea of a visual heirarchy, looking at a lot of news sites or even just shopping sites, it's easy to see this come into play. 

Javascript:

Intro- Im sorry, I cant get over how pretty and fun this book is. Why aren't all textbooks like this? I think a lot more people could learn a wide variety of things if textbooks looked pretty. Anyways, I didn't realize how much Javascript affects the HTML. We've been learning a lot about buttons and funtions, but there is so much more that Javascript can do. It blows my mind to see Javascript being used in this way.

Ch.1- I really like the easy to read style in learning how to design a script. It is a lot of what Dani is showing us how to do in making a plan. Also, I like that the writer talks about the difference between vocabulary and syntax. The way it is framed in this book makes a lot of sense. I love the Hotel model that is used. It takes it a part piece by piece which is nice. It was a bit confusing, but this is def a book I don't mind reading again or if I am stuck on something.
